Dear Hiring Team,

I have experience with Java, C#, C++, SQL (Postgres), and Excel. I'm loading up on math courses so that I can pursue quantitative, data-driven roles in the future. While I don't have previous experience in finance, I am seriously considering it as a career path.

I am a no-nonsense hard worker looking for challenging software engineering opportunities that push me to adapt and learn quickly. My experience co-leading Columbia Space Initiative's software team has honed my ability to work effectively in high-pressure, collaborative environments. I regularly plan, organize, and communicate technical information to team members with varying levels of experience.

This summer, I worked on multiple projects involving security and automation challenges, which included developing Excel workflow automation tools and working with SQL databases. I demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by analyzing complex systems and proposing creative solutions, while regularly presenting my work to stakeholders.

My coursework in Advanced Programming, Databases, and Data Structures, combined with my practical experience in various programming languages, has prepared me well for enterprise software development. I am particularly drawn to Garda Capital Partners because it would allow me to apply my technical skills in a quantitative, fast-paced environment while learning about financial markets.

Sincerely,
Joshua Hegstad
